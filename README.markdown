## Welcome
This project provides [Python] (http://www.python.org) publishing scripts for a 
[CKAN] (http://wiki.ckan.net/Main_Page) repository.  Currently, the scripts are focused on
publishing [ESRI] (http://www.esri.com) feature classes into CKAN datasets using ESRI's [arcpy] 
(http://help.arcgis.com/en/arcgisdesktop/10.0/help/index.html#//000v000000v7000000.htm) site package.


### About
This project was created in partnership with [Open Colorado] (http://www.opencolorado.org) and 
Colorado Smart Communities.  

These scripts were created for communities that want to leverage the Colorado CKAN 
repository (http://colorado.ckan.net).

There is no specific implemention in this project related to colorado.ckan.net so this can be
used with any CKAN instance.
